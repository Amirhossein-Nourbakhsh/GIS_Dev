This zip file contains:

1. A pdf file shows overview topo maps from various years and topo map series. 

2. The Subfolders contain raw GeoTIFFs at a higher resolution than that are shown in the pdf overview maps.

	•Each subfolder contains GeoTIFFS from a report year and from a map series at a specific scale 
	(e.g. 1993_7.5_24000). 

	•Within a folder, the file names are the original USGS Topo map names, with the report year added after the map source year. 

	•For example, "MD_Lanham_256518_1965_1993_24000_geo.tif" indicates the USGS topo map is "MD_Lanham_256518_1965_24000_geo", and year "1993" is our report 
	 year in which the map was last revised or checked.
